# Studying Classification Models for Income Class and Assessing the Fairness and Bias of the Models in the Context of Adult Census Dataset

Fairness is an important concern in present times as machine learning models are used more and more for 
supporting decision making in high stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and criminal sentencing, etc. 
Ensuring the fairness of these models is highly necessary so that no discrimination is made between different 
demographic groups (example- race, sex, age, and others) while using these models for decision making. 
Different algorithms have been developed to measure unfairness and mitigate them to a certain level.
This paper delves into the exploration, analysis of unfairness and prediction of income using machine learning 
models applied to the Adult Census dataset. Extracted from the 1994 census database, this dataset, sourced 
from Kaggle has 14 attributes, 32562 data points and a binary response variable stating whether an individual 
makes more than 50k dollars annually or not. 
The primary objective of this paper is to investigate and mitigate the presence of social bias, particularly 
concerning race and gender within these predictive models. In this paper, the raw data was first cleaned and 
pre-processed, then a detailed exploratory data analysis will be performed on the data, following which various 
machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest are employed to develop 
models and check their accuracy and performance. Finally, we propose to evaluate their fairness across 
demographic groups. 
Ultimately this study aims to raise awareness of the presence of bias and unfairness in machine learning 
models and techniques to quantify and mitigate them.
